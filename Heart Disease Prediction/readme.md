# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. The model is built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## Features

* Analyzes patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other medical features.
* Predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease (`1`) or healthy (`0`).
* Provides accuracy scores on both training and test datasets.
* Can make predictions for new patient data through a simple input interface.

## Dataset

The model uses a structured CSV dataset containing medical attributes and a target column indicating heart disease presence.

## Model Used

* **Logistic Regression** â€“ a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems.

## How it Works

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Check for missing values and perform basic data analysis.
3. Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Train the Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy scores.
6. Predict heart disease for new patient data.
