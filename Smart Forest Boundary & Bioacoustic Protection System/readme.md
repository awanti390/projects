# Smart Forest Boundary & Bioacoustic Protection System

This project introduces an intelligent forest-monitoring solution that integrates IoT, AI, and Machine Learning to protect forest ecosystems and reduce human–wildlife conflict. Using visual sensors, MEMS microphones, and LoRa-based communication, the system performs real-time detection of wildlife movement, human intrusion, and illegal activities such as chainsaw operation and poaching.

By combining image detection and bioacoustic sound classification, it provides accurate alerts while operating on low power and long range—making it suitable for large forest areas. The system aims to support forest officials with a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and scalable alternative to traditional patrolling and camera traps, ultimately enhancing conservation efforts and promoting ecological sustainability.
